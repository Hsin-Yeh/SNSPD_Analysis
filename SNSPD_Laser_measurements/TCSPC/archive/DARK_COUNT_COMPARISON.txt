                   DARK COUNT ESTIMATION METHOD COMPARISON
                   Out-of-Time (OOT) vs Block 0 Baseline
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW:
─────────
Two dark count estimation methods are compared across 43 SNSPD measurements
spanning a 1,204× power dynamic range (0.0119 µW to 14.33 µW):

  Method A (Block 0 Direct):   Single fixed measurement at 0 µW = 17.73 cts/s
  Method B (OOT Scaled):       Per-measurement estimate from 0-10 ns region,
                               scaled to 5.4 ns signal window

KEY STATISTICS:
───────────────
Block 0 Baseline:                    17.73 cts/s (fixed, absolute reference)
OOT Mean:                            12.94 cts/s (range: 0.00 - 21.19 cts/s)
OOT Std Dev:                         8.17 cts/s

Absolute Difference (OOT - Block 0):
  Mean:                              -4.80 cts/s  
  Aggregate Percentage:              -27.0%

PERCENTAGE DEVIATION ANALYSIS (43 measurements):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Mean Deviation:                    -27.0%
  Standard Deviation:                +46.1%
  Minimum:                          -100.0%  (at highest power: 14.33 µW)
  Maximum:                          +19.5%   (at 0.0718 µW)

POWER-DEPENDENT PATTERN:
────────────────────────
The OOT method shows systematic underestimation that varies with power:

HIGH POWER REGIME (1-14 µW):
  - Extreme underestimation: -100% to -36.5%
  - OOT estimates approach 0 cts/s
  - Block 0 baseline provides more reliable value
  - Reason: At high signal rates, out-of-time window may be depleted or
    affected by dead-time corrections

MEDIUM POWER REGIME (0.1-1 µW):
  - Moderate underestimation: -16.3% to +2.6%
  - OOT estimates: 14-19 cts/s (closer to Block 0)
  - Reasonable agreement begins

LOW POWER REGIME (0.01-0.1 µW):
  - Mixed bias: -2.7% to +19.5%
  - OOT estimates: 17-21 cts/s
  - Best agreement with Block 0 baseline
  - Slight tendency for overestimation (+8% typical)
  - Physically more realistic: higher variance expected at low rates

14.33 µW      0.00         17.73    -17.73        -100.0%    [Severe underestimation]
9.87 µW       0.00         17.73    -17.73        -100.0%
1.14 µW       11.27        17.73    -6.47         -36.5%
0.141 µW      18.45        17.73    +0.72         +4.0%      [Good agreement]
0.072 µW      21.19        17.73    +3.45         +19.5%     [Overestimation at low power]
0.012 µW      18.97        17.73    +1.24         +7.0%      [Near baseline]

INTERPRETATION:
────────────────
1. OOT Method Limitation: The out-of-time dark count estimation from 0-10 ns
   region becomes unreliable at high signal rates where:
   - Dead time effects become significant
   - The histogram baseline shifts or depletes
   - Per-measurement variations are large

2. Block 0 Baseline Advantage: Single fixed measurement provides consistent,
   physically-grounded reference (actual 0 µW dark count measurement)

3. Practical Recommendation:
   * Use Block 0 baseline (17.73 cts/s) for dark count subtraction
   * OOT method is variable and power-dependent
   * Residual bias range: -27% +/- 46% (too large for routine use)
   * OOT method NOT suitable for automatic per-measurement correction

4. Model Validation: With Block 0 dark count subtraction:
   - Power law exponent: n = 1.0542 +/- 0.0335
   - R-squared = 0.9897 (excellent fit)
   - Nearly linear responsivity confirmed
