Refactor TCSPC analysis: organize structure, implement external Block 0 reference, add adaptive fitting

Major changes:
- Reorganized directory structure (docs/, utils/, archive/)
- Added comprehensive README.md with workflow documentation
- Implemented external Block 0 reference system for dark count measurements
- Added adaptive fit range for biases with limited low-power data (e.g., 66mV)
- Updated power data parser for new interpolated format (1 degree resolution)
- Fixed dark_count_rate None handling throughout read_phu.py
- Added --debug flag for verbose output control
- Added 73mV to combined plot configuration
- Created tcspc_config.py for centralized configuration
- Extracted analysis functions to tcspc_analysis.py module

New features:
- process_all_bias.py: Batch processing with external Block 0 references
- create_combined_plot.py: Comparison plots with adaptive fit range
- utils/inject_block0_from_0nW.py: Alternative Block 0 injection utility

File organization:
- docs/: Documentation and integration summaries
- utils/: Utility scripts (Block 0 injection)
- archive/: Old test files and debug scripts

Data updates:
- Added Rotation_10MHz_1degree_data_20260205.txt (356 points, 0-355 degrees)
- Added interpolation scripts and reports in Attenuation/

All 5 biases (66mV, 70mV, 73mV, 74mV, 78mV) now successfully processed
